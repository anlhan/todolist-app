# todolist-app

Hi. This project contains 2 seperated applications which suppose to communicate each other via REST Apis. 
Back-end application is developed with Spring Boot and front-end side developed as a React app.

It is a quite simple example of a to-do list management application.
There are 2 pages which are contain several components responsible for listing,creating,deleting and updating respective to-do lists
and their to-do list items.

First page lists all the to-do lists and provides a form component in order to create a new to-do list.
Second page contains all to-do list items belong to the to-do list which is being inspected and a new list item creation form.

You need to have Node.js in order to gather dependencies of the React App.
Spring boot app dependency management is covered by Maven.
